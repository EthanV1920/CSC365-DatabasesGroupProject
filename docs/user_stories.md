As a casual online player, I hope to quickly unlock most characters to give me a wide variety of characters to try.

As a buy then play for one hour player, I hope that the default unlocks are fun enough to engage me for a bit. So that I am not frusturated with wasting my time and money

As a casual LAN player, I hope that unlocking all the characters is not locked behind online PVP. So that my friends and I can have the most fun playing together without needing to complete a chore before hand.

As a game journalist, I hope there is a difficulty slider for the PVE campaign, So that I can quickly complete the game and get the fastest story out there.

As a professional player, I hope for fast response times, reliability, and good matchmaking. So that I can grind my skills more effectively for the big tournaments.

As a twitch viewer I hope to get the unique cosmetics my favorite streamers are all using. So that I can truly be friends with them and not just parasocial.

As a skin designer, I hope to be able to seemlessly be able to add cosmetics for any given character without any fuss. So that I can do my job easier.

As the board of directors, I hope there are as many paid cosmetics as humanly possible. So that I can squeeze as much money from my users as possible.

As a mod designer, I hope for a simple backend system that I can quickly append to or edit. To make moding the game easier.

As a person that plays a single character (a main), I hope to have plenty to unlock for my favorite character. So that I can do more with them.
