Parameters of project
In this course you will work with a small team to create a new backend API of your own design. There are a few requirements for your backend:

It has to be public. Don't propose something that you aren't willing to have be made public and freely available.
It needs to require a persistence layer (in this case a relational DB).
There needs to be read and write operations.

 For the group project we will be building the back end database for a popular video game, Mortal Kombat! For each player, we will track characters unlocked and xp. The read and write operations come into play when leveling up or selecting characters to equip.
