# Mortal Kombat Lookup

### Contributors: Victoria Asencio-Clemens, Isaac Lake, and Ethan Vosburg

## 

For the group project we will be building the back end database for a popular video game, Mortal Kombat! For each player, we will track characters unlocked and xp. The read and write operations come into play when leveling up or selecting characters 
to equip.

The goal is to make a way to interface with a database to retreive certain data about all of the differnt characters in the game. 

> [!NOTE]
> **Mortal Kombat** is a street figher like game that puts two players against eachother with differnet characters that have differnet traits. The two players fight each other until one remains using different skills and abilities to defeat the opponent. 

Parameters of project
In this course you will work with a small team to create a new backend API of your own design. There are a few requirements for your backend:

It has to be public. Don't propose something that you aren't willing to have be made public and freely available.
It needs to require a persistence layer (in this case a relational DB).
There needs to be read and write operations.
